# Data Science Project with the Iris Dataset

## Background:
I have selected the Iris Dataset from sklearn database for my first data science project. This data sets consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray

## Objective:
To predict the type of irises based on the attributes (e.g. petal and sepal length).
